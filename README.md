# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

This project was created to present the content learned in the prework as an organised website. Due to the large amount of content this website aimed to condense key information regarding HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript into one page. This makes it easier to study the content learnt in the prework without going over large amounts of content. Throughout this project I have learnt how to code using multiple languages, debug, reverse code etc.

## Usage

Each section of the website contains key information about HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git. When inspecting the website and opening the console Javascript can be seen running there. All topics studied in the prework are listed and one will be chosen to study.
